<!-- Display the lists on sales.html. We will be adding features to this application and working with its layout in the upcoming labs.

Here are the starting numbers that you’ll need to build these objects:

Location	Min / Cust	Max / Cust	Avg Cookie / Sale
Seattle	23	65	6.3
Tokyo	3	24	1.2
Dubai	11	38	3.7
Paris	20	38	2.3
Lima	2	16	4.6
These numbers are simply Pat’s estimates for now, but eventually, once there has been some history collected that provides more accurate numbers, we’ll want the ability to update these numbers for each location, and to add/remove locations. But we’ll not build all of that today. Make sure to make each location is its own JavaScript object. -->
